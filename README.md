**DCVC-RT is the first neural video codec (NVC)  achieving 100+ FPS 1080p coding and 4K real-time coding with a comparable compression ratio with ECM.**

**Beyond high compression ratio and fast coding speed, the primary goal of DCVC-RT is to pursue a more practical neural video codecsolution.** To achieve this, DCVC-RT prioritizes practical design choices, even if they come at the cost of compression efficiency. Currently, DCVC-RT supports several practical features, including:
- **Wide bitrate range in single model**: A single model enables continuous and controllable bitrate adjustments. DCVC-RT can compress at a wide bitrate range for different coding scenarios. It supports bitrates from approximately 50 kpbs (33.2dB) to 3000 kpbs (42.9dB) for 1080p dataset.
- **Rate control**: By adjusting quantization parameters, DCVC-RT effectively supports dynamic and various network conditions during real communication scenario.
- **Unified YUV and RGB coding**: While DCVC-RT is primarily optimized for the widely adopted YUV format, it can seamlessly adapt to RGB content coding.

We are continuously exploring additional practical functionalities and will provide further NVC solutions in this repository.

## :book: Overview

Welcome to the official implementation of DCVC-RT and the broader [DCVC-family](#clipboard-dcvc-family) models.

### Abstract

We introduce a practical real-time neural video codec (NVC) designed to deliver high compression ratio, low latency and broad versatility. In practice, the coding speed of NVCs depends on 1) computational costs, and 2) non-computational operational costs, such as memory I/O and the number of function calls. While most efficient NVCs prioritize reducing computational cost, we identify operational cost as the primary bottleneck to achieving higher coding speed. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a set of efficiency-driven design improvements focused on minimizing operational costs. Specifically, we employ implicit temporal modeling to eliminate complex explicit motion modules, and use single low-resolution latent representations rather than progressive downsampling. These innovations significantly accelerate NVC without sacrificing compression quality. Additionally, we implement model integerization for consistent cross-device coding and a module-bank-based rate control scheme to improve practical adaptability. Experiments show our proposed DCVC-RT achieves an impressive average encoding/decoding speed at 125.2/112.8 fps (frames per second) for 1080p video, while saving an average of 21\% in bitrate compared to H.266/VTM.

### Image Compression Performance

Notably, the intra-frame codec in DCVC-RT also delivers impressive performance. On Kodak, DCVC-RT-Intra achieves an 11.1% bitrate reduction compared to VTM, with a over 10× faster decoding speed than previous state-of-the-art learned image codecs. For encoding, DCVC-RT-Intra also offers a similar speed advantage. For 1080p content, DCVC-RT-Intra achieves an impressive encoding/decoding speed of 40.7 FPS / 44.2 FPS on an NVIDIA A100 GPU.

  <summary><font size="5"> CPU performance scaling</font></summary><br>

Note that the arithmetic coding runs on the CPU, please make sure your CPU runs at high performance while writing the actual bitstream. Otherwise, the arithmetic coding may take a long time.

Check the CPU frequency by
```
grep -E '^model name|^cpu MHz' /proc/cpuinfo
```

Run the following command to maximum CPU frequency
```
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

Run the following command to recover the default frequency
```
echo ondemand | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

  <summary><font size="5"> Test dataset</font></summary><br>

We support arbitrary original resolution. The input video resolution will be padded automatically. The reconstructed video will be cropped back to the original size. The distortion (PSNR) is calculated at original resolution.

#### YUV 420 content

Put *.yuv in the folder structure similar to the following structure.

    /media/data/HEVC_B/
        - BQTerrace_1920x1080_60.yuv
        - BasketballDrive_1920x1080_50.yuv
        - ...
    /media/data/HEVC_D/
    /media/data/HEVC_C/
    ...

The dataset structure can be seen in dataset_config_example_yuv420.json.

#### RGB content

We highly suggest testing YUV420 content. To test RGB content, please refer to the [DCVC-FM](DCVC-family/DCVC-FM) folder.

<details>

  <summary><font size="5"> Test the models</font></summary><br>

Example to test pretrained model with four rate points:
```bash
 python test_video.py --model_path_i ./checkpoints/cvpr2025_image.pth.tar --model_path_p ./checkpoints/cvpr2025_video.pth.tar --rate_num 4 --test_config ./dataset_config_example_yuv420.json --cuda 1 -w 1 --write_stream 1 --force_zero_thres 0.12 --output_path output.json --force_intra_period -1 --reset_interval 64 --force_frame_num -1 --check_existing 0
```

It is recommended that the ```-w``` number is equal to your GPU number.

You can also specify different ```--rate_num``` values (2~64) to test finer bitrate adjustment.

  <summary><font size="5"> On the comparison</font></summary><br>

Please note that different methods may use different configurations to test different models, such as
* Source video may be different, e.g., cropped or padded to the desired resolution.
* Intra period may be different, e.g., 96, 32, 12, or 10.
* Number of encoded frames may be different.

So, it does not make sense to compare the numbers in different methods directly, unless making sure they are using same test conditions.

Please find more details on the [test conditions](./test_conditions.md).
