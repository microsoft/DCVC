# Introduction

Official Pytorch implementation for Neural Video and Image Compression including:
* Neural Video Codec
  * DCVC: [Deep Contextual Video Compression](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/96b250a90d3cf0868c83f8c965142d2a-Paper.pdf), NeurIPS 2021, in [this folder](./DCVC/).
  * DCVC-TCM: [**T**emporal **C**ontext **M**ining for Learned Video Compression](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9941493), in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, and [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13850), in [this folder](./DCVC-TCM/).
  * DCVC-HEM: [**H**ybrid Spatial-Temporal **E**ntropy **M**odelling for Neural Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05894), ACM MM 2022, in [this folder](./DCVC-HEM/).
    -  The first end-to-end neural video codec to exceed H.266 (VTM) using the highest compression ratio configuration, in terms of both PSNR and MS-SSIM.
    -  The first end-to-end neural video codec to achieve rate adjustment in single model.
  * DCVC-DC: [Neural Video Compression with **D**iverse **C**ontexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14402), CVPR 2023, in [this folder](./DCVC-DC/).
    -  The first end-to-end neural video codec to exceed [ECM](https://jvet-experts.org/doc_end_user/documents/27_Teleconference/wg11/JVET-AA0006-v1.zip) using the highest compression ratio configuration, in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM for RGB content.
    -  The first end-to-end neural video codec to exceed ECM using the highest compression ratio configuration, in terms of PSNR for YUV420 content.
* Neural Image Codec
  * [EVC: Towards Real-Time Neural Image Compression with Mask Decay](https://openreview.net/forum?id=XUxad2Gj40n), ICLR 2023, in [this folder](./EVC/).

# On the comparison

Please note that different methods may use different configurations to test different models, such as
* Source video may be different, e.g., cropped or padded to the desired resolution.
* Intra period may be different, e.g., 96, 32, 12, or 10.
* Number of encoded frames may be different.

So, it does not make sense to compare the numbers in different methods directly, unless making sure they are using same test conditions.

Please find more details on the [test conditions](./test_conditions.md).
